# 🌊 WEISME SUI VIBE FEST

![Project Logo](./public/logo.png)

> **"Immortalize your vibe on-chain. A cyberpunk gateway to the Sui ecosystem."**

## 📖 Project Description
**WEISME SUI VIBE FEST** is a high-energy, cyberpunk-themed decentralized application (dApp) built on the **Sui blockchain**. It bridges the gap between ephemeral feelings and blockchain immutability, allowing users to express their current "vibe" and permanently inscribe it on-chain as a unique digital artifact.

This project was built with the **"Vibe Coding"** philosophy, leveraging AI assistance to lower the barrier to entry for Actuarial Science graduates entering the Web3 space.

### ✨ Key Features
- **Cyberpunk Aesthetic**: A custom retro-futuristic UI with neon glows, animated grids, and floating particles built with Tailwind CSS.
- **Seamless Onboarding**: Instant wallet integration via `@mysten/dapp-kit` (supports Slush, Sui Wallet, etc.).
- **On-Chain Permanence**: Every vibe is minted as a **Move Object** on the Sui Mainnet using the latest Move 2024 syntax.
- **High Performance**: Powered by Next.js 16 and deployed on Vercel for lightning-fast interactions.

## 🛠 Tech Stack & Tools
- **Frontend**: Next.js 16 (App Router), React, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
- **Blockchain Integration**: `@mysten/dapp-kit`, `@mysten/sui`
- **Smart Contract**: Sui Move (Move 2024 Edition)
- **Deployment**: Vercel (Frontend), Sui Mainnet (Contracts)
- **Development Tools**: Cursor, ChainIDE, Node.js
